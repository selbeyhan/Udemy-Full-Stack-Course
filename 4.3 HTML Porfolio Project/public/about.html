<center><h1>About Me</h1></center>
<p>
  My name is Selman, and I am delighted to have this opportunity to share a
  little bit about myself. I recently finished my first year as a committed
  student at the University of Houston with a lot of grit and passion, and I'm
  anxious to start my second year with even more grit and a thirst for
  knowledge. Originally born in Turkey, my multicultural background has shaped
  my worldview and instilled in me a deep appreciation for diversity, different
  perspectives, and the power of cross-cultural connections. My perspectives
  have been widened and my desire for learning about new concepts, technology,
  and the endless possibilities they present has been stoked by exposure to
  diverse cultures. I have acquired a strong interest in and aptitude for
  computer science and technology throughout my academic career. The ability of
  digital solutions to transform industries and enhance lives has always
  attracted me. I've focused on becoming a full-stack developer in the future
  with this enthusiasm. I have a natural interest and desire to solve problems,
  so having the chance to design, create, and deploy both the front-end and
  back-end of web apps appeals to me. I'm eager to learn more about software
  development and grow my skills in various programming languages and frameworks
  so that I can create applications that are reliable, intuitive, and effective.
  Together with my technical abilities, I strongly believe in teamwork,
  collaboration, and ongoing learning. Technology has the power to change the
  world, but it also has the capability to unite people in order to tackle
  difficult problems, in my opinion. I actively look for chances to interact
  with like-minded people, take part in hackathons, and contribute to
  open-source projects since these events promote personal growth and let me
  share my own insights while also learning from others. Despite my academic
  goals, I place a high priority on preserving a positive work-life balance. I
  enjoy reading books that broaden my perspective, trying out new recipes in the
  kitchen, and exploring new hiking trails in my spare time. In my opinion,
  embracing varied experiences outside of the digital sphere improves
  creativity, inspires me, and ultimately helps me become a more well-rounded
  person. I am ready to sponge up knowledge, take on challenges, and make
  significant contributions to the field of technology as I continue my study at
  the University of Houston. I'm sure that my enthusiasm, ambition, and
  attention to lifelong learning will help me go where I want to go and have an
  effect as a full-stack developer. I appreciate you taking the time to learn
  more about me, and I'm looking forward to getting in touch with people who are
  as passionate about innovation and technology as I am.
